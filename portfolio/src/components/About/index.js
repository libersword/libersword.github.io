<h2>About Me.</h2>
<h3>From just an art geek, to a geek geek.</h3>
<p>
Graduated from Colorado Mesa University with a degree in Graphic Design and a minor in computer science, I embarked to Denver for a job in Web Design. After that company unexpectedly closed down, I searched for another job. As I was job hunting, I decided to enroll in a Full Stack Development Bootcamp through University of Denver to further my skills. I landed another Web Designer job with a larger focus on code. When I am not working and going to school, you can find me at metal show in the small Denver bars, drawing,or playing videogames.</p>
